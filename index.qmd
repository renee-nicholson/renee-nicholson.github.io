Hello! My name is Renee and I use she/her/hers pronouns. I am a senior, Chemistry major at Macalester College, with minors in Biology and Data Science. I play on the softball team and in my free time, I enjoy going on walks, hanging out with family and friends, trying new recipes, and crafting.

In the fall of 2023, I had the amazing opportunity to study away for a semester in Scotland.
