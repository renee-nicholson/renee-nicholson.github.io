Hello! My name is Renee and I use she/her/hers pronouns. I am a senior, chemistry major at Macalester College, with minors in biology and data science. I play on the softball team and in my free time, I enjoy going on walks, hanging out with family and friends, trying new recipes, and crafting.

In the fall of 2023, I had the amazing opportunity to study away for a semester in Scotland. I studied in Glasgow and got to explore the Highlands a bunch!
